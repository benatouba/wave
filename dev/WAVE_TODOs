Non-exhaustive list of todos (order is not related to the importance or the difficulty of the task):

-> Update the doc for IDLdoc
Look for errors in the doc, update the overview file and make the last IDLdoc version run on it

-> Make a wrapper for cgPlot adapted to data-time
The idea is very simple: make a routine called w_tplot which works exactly like cgPlot 
(in fact, it calls cg plot internally) but accepts only time (QMS or ABS_DATE) as input
and performs some axis formatting. It must combine the two routines cgPlot and w_date_tickformat
in one single routine

-> use the new w_tplot routine to finally make a nice timeline plot routine

-> improve w_QuickPlot
Sooooo many possibilities! 
Allow Time and Z dimensions to be a moving slice
Keep Aspect ratio when resizing the window
Clean the code
Etc...


-> timeseries
the major drawback on timeseries right now is the incompatibility with monthly/annual timeseries
the problem is, it needs strong re-thinking of the way timesteps work

-> Plot points as data on a map
Update the w_map object to plot point data as "real" data with colorbar update, etc. (easy)

-> MAJOR: Grids
redesign the gridded datasets to ONE single interface that have to implement all the WRF, TRMM and others...

-> MAJOR: HARMONIZATION of the WAVE 
revise ALL old routines that are lost in .PRO files, rename them for w_* and put them 
in a new directory. Get rid of the @WAVEstart.mac

-> MEGAMAJOR: make the WAVE independant from the TNT
